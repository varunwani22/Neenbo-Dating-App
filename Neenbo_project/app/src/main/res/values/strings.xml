    <string name="text_i_accept_terms">1. Acceptance of Terms of Use Agreement.

        By creating a Tinder account, whether through a mobile device, mobile application or
        computer (collectively, the Service) you agree to be bound by (i) these Terms of Use,
        (ii) our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Arbitration Procedures (if applicable to you) and
        Safety Tips, each of which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement, and (iii) any
        terms disclosed and agreed to by you if you purchase additional features, products or
        services we offer on the Service (collectively, this "Agreement"). If you do not accept
        and agree to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement, please do not use the Service.

         We may make changes to this Agreement and to the Service from time to time. We may do this
         for a variety of reasons including to reflect changes in or requirements of the law,
         new features, or changes in business practices. The most recent version of this Agreement
         will be posted on the Service under Settings and also on gotinder.com, and you should
         regularly check for the most recent version. The most recent version is the version that
          applies. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations,
         we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include
         notification through the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service after
         the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.
          2. Eligibility.
             You must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on Tinder and use the
             Service. By creating an account and using the Service, you represent and warrant that:

             you can form a binding contract with Neenbo,
             you are not a person who is barred from using the Service under the laws of the
             United States or any other applicable jurisdiction–meaning that you do not appear on
             the U.S. Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or face any
             other similar prohibition,
             you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national and
             international laws, rules and regulations, and
            you have never been convicted of a felony or indictable offense
            (or crime of similar severity), a sex crime, or any crime involving violence, and that
              you
              are not required to register as a sex offender with any state, federal or local sex
            offender registry.


       3. Your Account.

            In order to use Tinder, you may sign in using your Facebook login.  If you do so, you
             authorize us to access and use certain Facebook account information, including but not
          limited to your public Facebook profile. For more information regarding the information we
            collect from you and how we use it, please consult our Privacy Policy.

           You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials you use
           to sign up for Tinder, and you are solely responsible for all activities that occur under
             those credentials. If you think someone has gained access to your account, please
            immediately contact us.


      4. Modifying the Service and Termination.

             Neenbo is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality
               that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may add new product features or
             enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions
            do not
               materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice
           before
              taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify
            you in
            advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns,
              prevent us from doing so.

            You may terminate your account at any time, for any reason, by following the instructions
            in "Settings" in the Service, however if you use a third party payment account, you will
           need to manage in app purchases through such account (e.g., iTunes, Google Play) to avoid
          additional billing. Tinder may terminate your account at any time without notice if it
          believes that you have violated this Agreement. Upon such termination, you will not be
          entitled to any refund for purchases. After your account is terminated, this Agreement
          will terminate, except that the following provisions will still apply to you and Neenbo:
          Section 4, Section 5, and Sections 12 through 19.


        5. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Members.

        Though Neenbo strives to encourage a respectful member experience through features like the
        double opt-in that allows members to communicate only after they have both indicated
        interest in one another, it is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off of
        the Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other members, particularly
        if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. In addition, you agree to
        review and follow Tinder’s Safety Tips prior to using the Service. You agree that you will
        not provide your financial information
        (for example, your credit card or bank account information),
        or wire or otherwise send money, to other members.

        YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEMBERS. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
        NEENBO DOES NOT CONDUCT CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CHECKS ON ITS MEMBERS OR OTHERWISE INQUIRE INTO
        THE BACKGROUND OF ITS MEMBERS. TINDER MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES AS
        TO THE CONDUCT OF MEMBERS.


      6. Rights Neenbo Grants You.

        Neenbo grants you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, nonexclusive,

        devices settings.

        Service. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Arbitration Agreement in Section 15 above shall
        be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. For the avoidance of doubt, the choice of Texas

        jurisdictions.

         This Agreement, along with the Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, the Safety Tips,
        the Arbitration Procedures (if applicable to you), and any terms disclosed and agreed to by

        If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of this Agreement shall
        continue in full force and effect. The failure of the Company to exercise or enforce any
        right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
        provision.
        You agree that your Tinder account is non-transferable and all of your rights to your
        account and its Content terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint venture,
